        <p id="plo-koon-bio">Plo Koon was a Force-sensitive Kel Dor Jedi Master who served as a member of the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Galactic Republic. He served as a respected Jedi General during the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic conflict between the Republic and its splinter state, the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the war he frequently undertook dangerous missions with the soldiers under his command, the 104th Battalion. Koon wore a breath mask to filter the air around him so that it matched his home planet of Dorin, and wore goggles to prevent his eye fluids from evaporating.</p>
